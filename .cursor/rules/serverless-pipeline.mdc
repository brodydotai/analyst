# Serverless Rules
- Never use long-running loops or `while True`. Use Cron triggers.
- For background tasks (Scraping -> Summarizing), use Upstash QStash to avoid Vercel timeouts.
- Database: Use Supabase client for both Python and Node.
- Real-time: Use Supabase Realtime for the frontend feed, not raw WebSockets.
