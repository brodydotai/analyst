# Targeted Search Query Templates

Purpose: reduce exploratory search noise and token waste. Use these templates before broad web queries.

## Usage Rules

- Start with 3-5 targeted queries from the relevant playbook block below.
- Prefer primary sources (filings, investor relations, regulator docs, company releases).
- Only run additional exploratory queries when targeted queries fail to answer a required element.
- Keep copied evidence concise and cite URLs.

## Query Template Format
