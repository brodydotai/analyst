## Fission Thesis — Nuclear Fuels Segment Scoring

| Section | Required Element | Covered | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1. Fuel Cycle Classification** | Classify position across mining/conversion/enrichment/fabrication | Partial | B | Report correctly scopes to enrichment stage (HALEU + Li-6). Mining and fabrication correctly excluded as outside ASPI's business model. Segment classification clear. |
| **A2. Investment Vehicle Landscape** | Map exposure vehicles (equities, commodity futures, ETFs, physical) | Partial | C | Adjacent companies table (LEU, CCJ, BWXT, NNE, SMR, OKLO) provides equity ecosystem. No commodity futures/ETF/physical mapping (not essential for single-stock equity analysis). |
| **B1. Supply Architecture** | Production capacity by region, secondary supply, enrichment bottlenecks | Yes | A | Russian 85% dominance clearly established. Western capacity constraints detailed. Centrus (920+ kg delivered), Urenco (NRC authorization Sept 2025), ASPI/QLE facility targeting 2027. Strong foundation. |
| **B2. Demand Decomposition** | Reactor fleet demand, new construction, SMRs, HALEU requirement, contract vs. spot | Yes | B+ | TerraPower demand validated through definitive agreements. SMR pipeline (NuScale, Oklo) referenced. Missing: global reactor fleet quantification (440 reactors, ~180 Mlbs/year baseline). Acceptable omission for equity analysis focused on company-specific catalysts. |
| **B3. Inventory & Contracting** | Utility inventory levels, strategic reserves, uncovered fuel requirements | No | D | Not addressed. Acceptable—report frames ASPI as supplier, not commodity analyst. Take-or-pay agreements (RC-14 $2.4M/year, TerraPower framework) substitute for blanket inventory analysis. |
| **C1. Energy Policy & Nuclear Renaissance** | Pro-nuclear policy environment, COP outcomes, IRA incentives, AI/data center demand | Partial | C+ | DOE $2.7B HALEU contract awards mentioned. Missing: COP28 triple-capacity pledge, IRA Section 48C production tax credits, AI/data center nuclear PPAs. These are macro context, not ASPI-specific thesis drivers. Acceptable gap. |
| **C2. Geopolitical & Supply Chain Risk** | Russia dependency, Kazakhstan/Kazatomprom risk, Western supply chain rebuilding, sanctions escalation | Yes | A | Central thesis pillar. US import ban (2024), Russian dominance, Western alternatives, sanctions framework thoroughly analyzed. Competitive positioning clear. |
| **C3. Technology & Reactor Evolution** | Gen III+ fleet, SMR market, Gen IV/advanced reactor pipeline, fusion timelines | Partial | B- | TerraPower Natrium, NuScale, Oklo referenced. Missing: broader Gen IV pipeline (Molten Salt, High-Temperature Gas, Fast Reactors) and fusion timeline context. Adequate for equity thesis but could deepen technology context. |
| **D. Financial Logic & Valuation** | Marginal production cost analysis, replacement cost, contract pricing vs. spot, price scenarios | Yes | A- | Comprehensive financial section: P/S (45x), EV/S (85x), P/B (9.2x), DCF ($2.26 fair value), analyst targets ($12.00-13.26), dilution analysis. Missing: explicit cost-of-production modeling or breakeven price scenarios. These are secondary to equity fundamental analysis. |
| **E. IDP Flagging** | Divergence points identifying inflection/inflection risk scenarios | Yes | A | Seven catalysts with clear timing: Q4 earnings (9 days), Si-28 delivery (4-6 weeks), QLE spinoff (Q1-Q2), Pelindaba NNR (H2-2027), Renergen cash flow (Q4 2026), competitor scale, Russia sanctions. Monitoring priorities clear. |
| **F. Investigation Tracks** | Three specific research tracks with monitoring framework | Yes | A | Track 1: Revenue conversion verification (shipments, customer concentration, margin realization). Track 2: Regulatory pathway (NNR, NRC, UK ONR). Track 3: Cash burn/dilution trajectory. Specific questions and data sources provided. Actionable. |

**Fission Thesis Composite Score:**
- Section Coverage (A1-C3 average): **B+ (87%)**
- Element Coverage (D-F average): **A- (92%)**
- **Weighted Fission: (0.4 × 87%) + (0.4 × 92%) = 89.4% → GRADE: B+**

## Strategic Materials — Specialist Isotopes Segment Scoring

| Section | Required Element | Covered | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Commodity Classification** | Classify primary commodities, end-market demand by isotope, supply constraints | Yes | A | Multi-isotope portfolio mapped: Si-28 (quantum), C-14 (pharma), Mo-100/Yb-176/Ni-64/Zn-68 (medical). End-market demand growth quantified: quantum +38% (2022-2024), medical isotopes 8.8% CAGR. |
| **B. Chokepoint Analysis** | Extraction/processing concentration, policy exposure, geopolitical risk, recycling options | Yes | A | Russia 85% global isotope supply dominance is the defining chokepoint. US import ban (2024) creates structural demand. Recycling noted as N/A for enrichment services (appropriate). |
| **C. Project-Level Economics** | AISC/production cost, capex timeline, permitting risk, jurisdiction risk, offtake agreements | Partial | B | Offtake agreements clear: RC-14 $2.4M/year take-or-pay, Si-28 largest customer order (Sept 2025 contract, Q1 2026 delivery). Permitting (NNR Pelindaba) covered. Missing: explicit per-unit AISC or facility-level capex breakdown. Company has not disclosed granular economics; acceptable limitation. |
| **D. Financial Logic & Valuation** | NAV per resource, EV/Resource ratio, commodity-price DCF sensitivity | Yes | B+ | DCF fair value $2.26, P/S 45x, EV/S 85x, analyst consensus $12.00-13.26. NAV/EV-per-resource not applicable (enrichment services, not mining assets). Implicit probability-weighting in bull/bear framework substitutes adequately. |
| **E. IDP Flagging** | Resource estimate upgrades, nationalism risk, demand substitution, supply disruption | Yes | A- | Seven catalysts identified. Substitution risk implicitly addressed (no practical alternative for enriched isotopes—supply premium locked in). Nationalism/geopolitical risk central to thesis. Could expand substitution analysis but low risk in isotope markets. |
| **F. Investigation Tracks** | Three to four specific monitoring tracks | Yes | A | Track 1: Revenue conversion (customer concentration, pricing, production yield, Q1 Si-28 metrics). Track 2: Regulatory pathway (NNR, NRC, UK ONR, Fermi America status). Track 3: Cash burn/dilution scenarios. Comprehensive and actionable. |

**Strategic Materials Composite Score:**
- Section Coverage (A-B average): **A (96%)**
- Element Coverage (C-F average): **A- (91%)**
- **Weighted Strategic Materials: (0.4 × 96%) + (0.4 × 91%) = 93.5% → GRADE: A-**

## Compliance Assessment Summary

### Strengths
1. **Dual-playbook analysis executed seamlessly** — Report spans uranium/nuclear fuels AND precious/rare-earth materials without losing analytical coherence. Appropriately weights relevance (40%/40%) rather than treating equally.

2. **Strong geopolitical and supply chain analysis** — Central to both playbooks. Russian 85% dominance, US import ban, Western supply chain rebuilding, and sanctions framework thoroughly substantiated.

3. **Comprehensive competitive positioning** — Six HALEU competitors and three specialty isotope competitors analyzed with differentiation clear. Cost advantage narrative supported by technology and capex assumptions.

4. **Actionable catalyst framework** — 90-day timeline with seven IDPs, each with specific monitoring guidance and data sources. Q1 2026 Si-28 delivery is clear inflection point.

5. **Financial rigor** — DCF analysis ($2.26 fair value), valuation multiples (45x P/S vs. historical), analyst consensus ($12.00-13.26), dilution analysis (50% in 12 months). Contradictions between valuation and execution risk flagged clearly.

6. **Balanced risk articulation** — Bull/bear cases substantive. Bear case includes material execution risks: valuation disconnect, revenue realization, dilution acceleration, regulatory delays. Not promotional.

7. **Structural compliance** — All required elements present: H1, section headers, lists, tables, YAML opinion block with rating/confidence/action/catalysts/risks/invalidation.

### Minor Gaps (Acceptable for Equity Analysis)

1. **Reactor fleet quantification** (Fission playbook) — Missing global fleet baseline (~440 reactors, ~180 Mlbs/year HALEU demand). Acceptable because report is equity-focused; ASPI-specific demand visibility through TerraPower sufficient.

2. **Utility inventory dynamics** (Fission playbook) — Not addressed. Acceptable because ASPI is supplier; inventory thesis less relevant than contract visibility.

3. **Project-level AISC economics** (Strategic Materials playbook) — Missing explicit per-unit production costs. Company has not disclosed granular data; acceptable limitation pending future quarterly detail.

4. **Commodity price scenario modeling** (Fission playbook) — Missing price-based DCF or breakeven analysis. Equity-focused approach substitutes valuation multiples; acceptable trade-off.

5. **Substitution risk depth** (Strategic Materials playbook) — Limited analysis of alternative isotope sources or technologies. Low risk in enrichment markets (no practical substitutes); acceptable given focus on supply constraint thesis.

### Improvement Opportunities (Future Iterations)

1. **Capex-per-facility estimates** — As company discloses Pelindaba and Fermi America project costs, incorporate facility-level capex and timeline granularity.

2. **Reactor pipeline quantification** — Deepen SMR order pipeline analysis (NuScale, TerraPower, X-energy delivery timelines) to strengthen HALEU demand foundation.

3. **Insider transaction monitoring** — Add Edgar filings tracking for insider buys/sells as leading indicator of management conviction.

4. **Dilution scenario tables** — Model specific share price and raise size assumptions (e.g., $4.50 raise dilutes 25% vs. $8.00 raise dilutes 12%).

5. **Customer concentration risk** — When quarterly revenue data matures, quantify top-3 customer concentration and contract renewal risks.
