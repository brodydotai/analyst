## A. Foundational Synthesis — Service Classification & End-Market Mapping

### A1. TIC Value Chain Position

TIC Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: TIC) operates across multiple layers of the TIC services ecosystem, creating an integrated platform for asset integrity and compliance:

**Nondestructive Testing (NDT)** — Core Competency (~55% of revenue): TIC Solutions is the largest North American NDT provider, offering radiographic, ultrasonic, magnetic particle, eddy current, and visual inspection services. This is the technical foundation of the business — field-deployed, certification-intensive, and deeply embedded in customer maintenance programs. Technicians hold ASNT Level II/III certifications, and nuclear-qualified personnel carry 5-10 years of specialized training.

**Asset Integrity Management (AIM)** — Growing Segment (~15% of revenue): Lifecycle monitoring, risk-based inspection, fitness-for-service assessment, and corrosion management programs. This segment commands higher margins (40-55%) and longer-duration contracts than field NDT work. The NV5 merger significantly expanded consulting and engineering capabilities in this area.

**Certification & Compliance** — Regulatory Driver (~10% of revenue): ISO/IEC 17025 accredited testing, API 510/570/653 code compliance, ASME pressure vessel inspection. This creates recurring demand cycles tied directly to regulatory mandates, providing a non-discretionary revenue floor.

**Rope Access / Specialty Access** — Bundled Service (~5% of revenue): Industrial rope access techniques (RAT) bundled with NDT services, reducing scaffolding costs for clients by 30-50% and improving facility access for elevated/confined inspections.

**Engineering & Consulting** — Highest Margin (~15% of revenue, post-NV5): Failure analysis, materials engineering, geospatial analytics, infrastructure assessment. The NV5 acquisition brought 51% gross margin consulting services and environmental engineering capabilities that command premium pricing.

**Revenue Mix Assessment:** TIC Solutions' weighted mix toward NDT field services creates a labor-intensive margin profile (25-35% gross margins on field work), but the post-NV5 portfolio now includes higher-margin consulting (51%) and geospatial (48%) segments that are margin-accretive. The integrated platform allows cross-selling — a customer initially engaged for NDT field inspection can be upsold into AIM consulting, engineering assessments, and geospatial analytics, creating wallet-share expansion dynamics.

### A2. End-Market Diversification & Cyclicality

TIC Solutions' pro forma end-market exposure (post-NV5 merger, August 2025):

| End Market | Revenue Share | Cyclicality | Growth Driver |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Infrastructure | ~25% | Low-Moderate | IIJA spending, aging bridges/structures |
| Industrial & Manufacturing | ~20% | Moderate | Industrial production cycles |
| Energy Processing / Oil & Gas | ~20% | Perceived-High, Actual-Moderate | Asset age + regulatory mandate (NOT commodity price) |
| Power, Utilities & Energy Transition | ~15% | Low | Regulatory, grid modernization, renewable buildout |
| Government Geospatial | ~10% | Low | Federal/state program spending |
| Midstream Infrastructure | ~5% | Low-Moderate | PHMSA Mega Rule mandates |
| Data Centers | ~2% | Low | Hyperscale buildout |
| Other | ~3% | Mixed | Diversified |

**End-Market Concentration Analysis:** The top 3 end markets (infrastructure, industrial, energy) comprise approximately 65% of revenue. This concentration is materially lower than pre-NV5 Acuren, which derived approximately 45% from oil & gas alone. The NV5 merger was explicitly designed to reduce energy sector cyclicality perception and command a higher valuation multiple.

**Critical Distinction — Energy Revenue and Commodity Prices:** A frequent misunderstanding among generalist investors is the assumption that TIC energy revenue correlates with oil prices. In reality, TIC demand in energy is driven by asset age and regulatory enforcement, not commodity prices. Refineries, pipelines, and petrochemical plants require inspection regardless of WTI pricing because: (a) regulatory mandates are non-discretionary, (b) equipment failure liability exceeds inspection costs by 100-1000x, and (c) turnaround schedules are set 12-24 months in advance based on mechanical integrity programs, not market conditions. However, this distinction is not fully reflected in TIC Solutions' valuation multiple, which still trades at a discount to diversified industrial services peers.

### A3. Regulatory Demand Drivers — The Non-Discretionary Floor

Regulatory mandates creating non-discretionary inspection requirements for TIC Solutions:

**OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) — 29 CFR 1910.119:** Requires mechanical integrity programs for all equipment in hazardous process facilities (refineries, chemical plants, petrochemical operations). PSM compliance mandates periodic inspection, testing, and documentation of pressure vessels, piping, relief devices, and emergency systems. Estimated 30-40% of TIC's energy sector revenue is PSM-driven.

**API 510/570/653 Inspection Codes:** Fixed inspection intervals for pressure vessels (API 510), piping systems (API 570), and aboveground storage tanks (API 653). These codes mandate external and internal inspection at defined frequencies (typically 5-10 year cycles), creating predictable recurring revenue streams. Code compliance is non-negotiable for continued facility operation.

**PHMSA Mega Rule — Major Growth Catalyst:** The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration's comprehensive rulemaking (effective 2023-2026) represents the most significant regulatory expansion for TIC services in a decade. Key provisions include: MAOP verification/testing for historical pipelines (dating to 1940s), expanded integrity management requirements for gathering lines (previously unregulated), intensified risk assessment mandates, and enhanced reporting requirements. Management has explicitly called out the PHMSA Mega Rule as a multi-year revenue tailwind, with pipeline operators required to update decades-old records and verify pipeline integrity on defined schedules.

**NRC 10 CFR 50.55a — Nuclear ISI:** In-Service Inspection requirements for nuclear facilities. TIC Solutions holds nuclear-qualified technician certifications that take 5-10 years to develop, creating a significant competitive moat. Nuclear inspection commands premium pricing (2-3x standard NDT rates).

**ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code:** Jurisdictional inspection requirements for all pressure equipment. State-by-state mandates create a geographically distributed compliance requirement.

**Regulatory Revenue Floor Estimate:** Approximately 50-60% of TIC Solutions' revenue is driven directly or indirectly by regulatory mandate. This non-discretionary floor provides recession resilience — during the 2020 COVID downturn, Acuren's revenue declined only 8-12%, compared to 20-30% declines for discretionary industrial services companies. However, the regulatory floor also limits pricing power, as customers view compliance inspections as a cost of doing business rather than a value-add investment.

## B. Unit Economics — The Labor Leverage Model

### B1. Technician Economics

TIC Solutions employs 11,000+ personnel across 250+ locations post-NV5 merger. Key unit economics (estimated from industry benchmarks and disclosed financials):

| Metric | Estimated Value | Industry Benchmark | Assessment |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Revenue per employee | ~$182K ($2B / 11,000) | $150-250K | In-line |
| NDT Level II bill rate | $85-150/hour | $80-160/hour | Competitive |
| Nuclear-qualified bill rate | $200-350/hour | $180-400/hour | Premium segment |
| Consulting/engineering rate | $150-300/hour | $140-300/hour | NV5 heritage |
| Bill rate vs. cost rate spread | ~40-55% | 40-60% | Healthy |
| Technician utilization | ~72-78% (estimated) | 70-80% target | Improving |

**Technician Retention — Critical Risk Factor:** The NDT industry faces a structural labor shortage — an estimated 60,000 new technicians are needed nationally, but only 25% of current technicians hold required certifications. The average NDT technician age is 40+, indicating an accelerating retirement wave over the next decade. TIC Solutions has not disclosed specific retention rates, but industry turnover for NDT technicians runs 15-25% annually. Turnover above 20% destroys profitability through recruitment costs ($15-25K per hire), training investment ($10-30K per technician for ASNT certification progression), and lost productivity during ramp-up (3-6 months to full utilization).

**Certification Depth:** TIC Solutions maintains one of the deepest certified technician pools in North America, including ASNT Level III examiners, nuclear-qualified inspectors, Nadcap-approved NDT specialists, and rope access technicians (IRATA/SPRAT certified). This certification depth is a meaningful competitive moat — competitors cannot rapidly hire or train equivalent personnel.

### B2. Contract Structure & Revenue Visibility

**Master Service Agreement (MSA) Coverage:** TIC Solutions operates under a strong MSA framework with its major industrial customers. While specific MSA coverage percentages are not publicly disclosed, management emphasizes "long-term customer relationships" and "run-and-maintain" recurring contracts as the foundation of revenue stability. Industry context suggests MSA coverage above 70% for operators of TIC's scale.

**Contract Duration:** Mix of multi-year MSAs (3-5 years for major accounts) and project-based engagements. The NV5 merger added government contracts (typically 1-5 year terms with renewal options) that provide high visibility.

**Turnaround Revenue:** Large-scale refinery and petrochemical plant turnarounds create revenue spikes (typically 20-40% above normal run-rate) but occur on predictable 3-5 year cycles. Turnaround scheduling is planned 12-24 months in advance, providing forward visibility. Estimated 15-20% of energy segment revenue is turnaround-related.

**Customer Retention:** Management emphasizes wallet-share expansion with existing customers as a primary growth strategy. While specific retention rates are not disclosed, the integrated service model (NDT + engineering + geospatial) creates multi-dimensional switching costs that exceed those of a single-service provider.

### B3. M&A as the Growth Engine

TIC is a structurally fragmented industry — the top 5 players hold less than 20% of global market share. Growth through acquisition is the primary scaling strategy.

**Recent M&A Track Record:**

| Deal | Date | Type | Multiple | Strategic Rationale |
|------|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| NV5 Global | Aug 2025 | Transformational | 10.3x EBITDA | Diversification into infrastructure/engineering; $25M synergies |
| ADV Integrity | Apr 2024 | Tuck-in | Undisclosed | Midstream/pipeline integrity; materials testing |
| 12 acquisitions (under American Securities) | 2019-2024 | Tuck-in | 6-9x EBITDA (est.) | Geographic/capability expansion |

**Integration Track Record:** Under American Securities' 5-year ownership (2019-2024), Acuren grew EBITDA by 90% — approximately 50% organic, 50% from 12 tuck-in acquisitions. This indicates strong integration discipline and margin improvement capability in acquired businesses. The NV5 merger is the first transformational deal, and integration execution is the primary near-term risk.

**NV5 Synergy Realization:** Initial cost synergy target of $20M was revised upward to $25M. Management reports synergies materializing in late Q4 2025 with acceleration expected into 2026. Target areas include administrative functions, insurance consolidation, facilities rationalization, and IT integration. Full run-rate expected by mid-2027.

**Acquisition Discipline — IDP Flag:**

> **IDP: Leverage Post-NV5 Concerns**
> Net leverage of 6.4-6.7x post-NV5 merger (vs. 3.2x pre-merger and management's long-term target below 3.0x) limits near-term acquisition capacity. TIC Solutions must demonstrate deleveraging through FCF generation before the market will reward its M&A growth engine narrative. If leverage remains above 5.0x through 2026, it signals either integration difficulties or lower-than-expected cash generation. Conversely, if leverage drops below 4.5x by mid-2026, it validates the integration thesis and reopens the tuck-in acquisition growth engine.

## C. Competitive Moat Assessment

**Certification Barriers (Strong):** NDT technician certification (ASNT Level I/II/III) requires 2-5 years of progressive training and documented experience. Nuclear qualifications require 5-10 years. A competitor entering the market cannot rapidly build a certified workforce — this is the most durable structural advantage in TIC services. TIC Solutions' 11,000-person team with deep certification coverage represents years of accumulated human capital that cannot be replicated through capital expenditure alone.

**Customer Relationships (Moderate-Strong):** Plant operators prefer incumbent TIC providers because inspection teams develop institutional knowledge of specific equipment, inspection history, and corrosion patterns. Switching TIC providers introduces risk — a new inspector unfamiliar with a facility's equipment may miss condition indicators that an incumbent would recognize. However, these switching costs are primarily relationship-driven rather than contractual, making them vulnerable to pricing pressure.

**Geographic Density (Strong):** TIC Solutions' 250+ locations across North America create a significant logistics advantage. For emergency callout work (unplanned inspections, equipment failures), response time is critical. A densely distributed branch network enables faster mobilization, lower travel costs, and higher technician utilization compared to competitors with sparse geographic coverage.

**Safety Record (Data Gap):** TRIR (Total Recordable Incident Rate) and EMR (Experience Modification Rate) data are not publicly disclosed by TIC Solutions. This is a material gap — safety record is the single most important qualification criterion for major industrial customers. A TRIR above 1.0 would disqualify TIC Solutions from many Tier 1 customer RFPs. We assume the safety record is competitive given TIC's customer base quality, but verification through direct inquiry or HSE reporting is warranted.

**Scale Advantage (Emerging):** At $2B pro forma revenue, TIC Solutions is among the largest TIC service providers in North America — significantly larger than Mistras Group ($707M revenue) and competing in scale with global Tier 1 operators (SGS, Bureau Veritas, Intertek) who historically have not emphasized North American industrial services with equivalent depth.

## D. Financial Logic & Valuation

### D1. Revenue & Margin Profile

| Metric | TIC Solutions (2024 PF) | Industry Benchmark | Assessment |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Revenue | ~$2.0B (pro forma) | — | Top-tier North American scale |
| Revenue growth (organic) | 3-7% | 3-7% | In-line |
| Gross margin | ~24% (compressed post-merger) | 25-40% | Below range; integration costs |
| EBITDA margin | 15.6-16.3% (2025E) | 12-20% | Mid-range |
| FCF conversion | ~30% of EBITDA ($73.7M/$240M) | 60-80% | Below range; debt service drag |

**Margin Trajectory:** Q2 2025 gross margins compressed to 24%, reflecting NV5 integration costs and product mix normalization. Management guides to 15.5-16.5% EBITDA margins for 2026, suggesting modest improvement. The upside case for margin expansion rests on: (a) higher-margin NV5 consulting and geospatial work becoming a larger revenue share, (b) cost synergy realization ($25M), and (c) operational leverage as utilization improves.

**Q3 2025 Earnings Miss — IDP Flag:**

> **IDP: Q3 EPS Miss Signals Integration Friction**
> TIC Solutions reported Q3 2025 EPS of -$0.08 versus consensus of +$0.17, a significant miss. Revenue of $473.9M and EBITDA of $77.3M (16.3% margin) were in-line, suggesting the miss came from below-the-line items (interest expense, integration costs, or tax). This pattern — EBITDA in-line but EPS missed — is consistent with the high leverage (6.4-6.7x) creating EPS sensitivity to interest rate movements and one-time merger costs. Watch for this pattern to persist through H1 2026.

### D2. Valuation Framework

**Current Valuation:**

| Metric | Value | Peer Benchmark |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Enterprise Value | ~$4.0B ($2.7B market cap + $1.45B net debt) | — |
| EV/EBITDA (2025E) | 16.0-16.7x ($4.0B / $240-250M) | 10-15x for quality TIC |
| EV/EBITDA (2026E) | 15.2-15.8x ($4.0B / $254-263M) | 13-18x for platform premium |
| P/E | N/M (negative earnings) | 15-25x for profitable TIC |
| FCF yield | ~2.6% ($73.7M / $2.7B mkt cap) | 4-6% for industrial services |

**Peer Comparison:**

| Company | EV/EBITDA | Revenue | EBITDA Margin | Growth | Leverage |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------------|--------|---------|
| TIC Solutions | 16-17x | $2.0B | 16% | 4-5% organic | 6.4x |
| Mistras Group (MG) | 5.6x | $707M | ~12% | Flat | ~2.3x |
| Bureau Veritas | 14-16x | $6.5B | 18-20% | 5-7% | 1.5x |
| SGS | 15-17x | $7.0B | 18-22% | 3-5% | 1.0x |
| Intertek | 13-15x | $3.5B | 17-19% | 4-6% | 1.2x |

**Platform Premium Assessment:** TIC Solutions trades at the upper end of the quality TIC range (16-17x vs. 13-18x for platform operators), which appears to price in: (a) #1 North American scale position, (b) diversified end-market exposure post-NV5, and (c) PHMSA Mega Rule growth catalyst. However, the current leverage (6.4x) is 3-4x higher than global peers (1.0-2.3x), creating a material financial risk premium that could compress the multiple if deleveraging stalls. The Mistras discount (5.6x) reflects smaller scale, lower margins, and single-market focus — TIC Solutions should trade at a premium, but the current spread (3x wider) appears generous given TIC's leverage.

## E. Pattern Matching & IDP Flagging

> **IDP: Organic Growth Deceleration While Acquisition Pace Accelerates**
> Q1 2025 organic growth was 7.2%, but Q2 decelerated to 2.0%. Meanwhile, the NV5 acquisition (August 2025) represents the largest deal in company history. This pattern — decelerating organic growth masked by transformational M&A — warrants monitoring. If organic growth remains below 5% through 2026 while integration consumes management attention, it suggests the underlying business may be losing momentum, with acquisitions serving as a growth narrative substitute rather than a genuine platform expansion.

> **IDP: Management Tenure Gap**
> Average management tenure of 0.7 years and average board tenure of 1.2 years post-merger is unusually low. While this is mechanically driven by the NV5 merger creating a new organizational structure, it means the combined leadership team has never operated through a downcycle together. Execution risk is elevated when a new team faces its first stress test.

> **IDP: Martin Franklin Sponsor Dynamics**
> TIC Solutions' path to public markets via Admiral SPAC (Martin Franklin) introduces sponsor incentive dynamics. Franklin holds ~16.7% of common shares. If Franklin begins selling within 12-18 months of the IPO lockup expiration, it signals the sponsor views the stock as fairly valued or overvalued. Conversely, if Franklin increases his position or deploys additional capital, it signals conviction in the turnaround narrative.

## F. Investigation Tracks

### Track 1: Labor Market Dynamics & Wage Inflation Trajectory
**Hypothesis:** The NDT technician shortage is the binding constraint on organic growth, and wage inflation is the primary margin headwind.
**Alpha Potential:** If wage inflation is running 5-8% annually and TIC Solutions can only pass through 3-5% in bill rate increases, gross margins compress 100-200bps annually — a stealth risk not captured in consensus estimates.
**Data Needed:** ASNT technician wage surveys, Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational data for NDT technicians (SOC code 17-3029), expert calls with refinery maintenance managers on bill rate trends.

### Track 2: PHMSA Mega Rule Revenue Quantification
**Hypothesis:** The PHMSA Mega Rule creates a $200-500M+ addressable market expansion for TIC Solutions over 3-5 years.
**Alpha Potential:** If the Mega Rule drives 2-4% incremental organic growth annually beyond base assumptions, it would justify a premium multiple and potentially 20-40% upside.
**Data Needed:** PHMSA enforcement action data, pipeline operator integrity management program filings, expert calls with pipeline compliance officers, management commentary on Mega Rule pipeline (no pun intended) of work.

### Track 3: NV5 Integration Execution Quality
**Hypothesis:** The NV5 merger will either prove transformational (similar to Jacobs/CH2M Hill) or become a drag on returns (similar to many industrial roll-ups that overpay).
**Alpha Potential:** Synergy realization above $25M and cross-sell revenue synergies (not yet quantified by management) would drive EBITDA to $280-300M by 2027, expanding the multiple. Underperformance on synergies with continued high leverage would compress the multiple to 12-14x.
**Data Needed:** Quarterly synergy realization tracking, customer reference calls on cross-sell traction, employee retention data post-merger, Glassdoor/employee sentiment monitoring.

### The Information Request

To refine these investigation tracks into high-conviction alpha, the following additional data would be required:
- ASNT annual compensation survey for NDT technicians by certification level and region
- PHMSA Integrity Management Program annual filings from top 20 pipeline operators
- TIC Solutions' TRIR and EMR data (not publicly disclosed; may require IR call)
- Plant turnaround scheduling databases from major refiners (HollyFrontier, Valero, Marathon)
- Expert network calls with 3-5 refinery maintenance managers who use TIC Solutions' services
- American Securities exit analysis (pre-IPO portfolio company performance report)
