## Executive Summary

Uranium markets in February 2026 stand at an inflection point. Spot prices have recovered above $100/lb for the first time in 17 months, reflecting a confluence of structural supply deficits, accelerating reactor construction, AI-driven data center demand, and policy tailwinds from COP28 commitments and U.S. domestic enrichment revitalization. Primary mine production remains ~140-145 Mlbs annually—30-40% below demonstrated reactor requirements of ~180 Mlbs/year. Long-term contract prices remain anchored at $75-85/lb but are beginning to rise, signaling tightening contracting cycles and accelerating utility procurement. This report synthesizes fuel cycle fundamentals, geopolitical supply chain vulnerabilities, and investment positioning to assess uranium's medium-term thesis through 2027-2030.

## A. Foundational Synthesis — Fuel Classification & Strategic Importance

### A1. Fuel Cycle Classification & Demand Profile

Uranium occupies a unique position in the energy infrastructure: a strategic commodity that is simultaneously essential to climate decarbonization (COP28's tripling target), national energy security (post-Russian LEU ban transition), industrial technology deployment (AI data centers), and advanced reactor development (SMRs and Gen IV systems).

The uranium **fuel cycle** consists of five sequential stages, each with distinct economics and supply bottlenecks:

1. **Mining & Milling**: Primary extraction from ore bodies via conventional (open pit/underground) or in-situ leach (ISL) methods. Globally, ~140-145 Mlbs U3O8 extracted annually; 43% from Kazakhstan (Kazatomprom and JVs), 15% from Canada (Cameco), 11% from Namibia (Rossing), 10% from Australia. Mining is capital-intensive, long-cycle (8-12 years from exploration to production), and sensitive to regulatory and permitting delays.

2. **Conversion**: Chemical conversion of milled U3O8 into uranium hexafluoride (UF6), the feedstock required for enrichment. Global conversion capacity ~60,000 tU annually, concentrated in Kazakhstan, France (Orano Malvési), Canada (Cameco), and the U.S. (Honeywell, Converdyn). Conversion economics are typically cost-plus; pricing averaged $8-12/kg conversion between 2020-2025.

3. **Enrichment**: Isotopic separation to increase U-235 concentration to 3-5% for light water reactors (LWRs) or 5-20% for small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced systems. Measured in Separative Work Units (SWU). Global enrichment capacity is ~70 million SWU/year; Russia (via Rosatom/TENEX) supplies ~46%, URENCO (Germany/Netherlands/UK) ~30%, France (Orano) ~10%, China ~10%, U.S. (Centrus/URENCO USA) expanding from ~3%. SWU pricing reached $155-159/SWU in late 2023; 2026 forecasts range $120-180/SWU depending on demand surge.

4. **Fuel Fabrication**: Assembly of enriched uranium into reactor fuel assemblies. Capacity is adequate globally; lead times are typically 12-18 months. Economics tied closely to enrichment costs and UF6 conversion rates.

5. **Back-end (Enrichment Tails, Recycling)**: Secondary supply sourced from enrichment tails stockpiles (accumulated depleted uranium that could be re-enriched), government nuclear stockpiles (US, Russia, UK, France collectively hold ~500+ Mlbs), and nuclear waste recycling (limited, but technically viable). Secondary supply is estimated at 20-30 Mlbs annually under baseline assumptions, declining to 15-20 Mlbs by 2035 as historical tails stockpiles deplete.

**Demand Profile**: Uranium is consumed exclusively by nuclear reactors (there is no non-energy or industrial uranium oxide demand of significance). ~440 operating reactors globally consume ~180 Mlbs U3O8 annually. Expansion is driven by:
- **Existing fleet uprates & lifetime extensions** (US: 20 new reactors + 3 restarts target by 2045; EU: 100+ GW of capacity additions)
- **New construction** (60 under construction, 110 planned, 350 proposed globally)
- **Advanced reactors** requiring specialized fuel forms (HALEU for SMRs; LEU+ for enhanced LWRs)

### A2. Investment Vehicle Landscape

Several instrument classes expose investors to uranium commodity upside:

1. **Physical Holdings**: Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SRUUF, U-UN.TO, U-U.TO) held ~78.4 Mlbs as of February 2026, with market value ~$7.28B. Yellow Cake PLC (YCUK, LSE) holds ~25Mlbs physical uranium. Both trade at minimal premiums to NAV in well-functioning markets.

2. **Equity Exposure** (Producers & Explorers):
   - **Large-cap producers**: Cameco (CCJ, ~15% of global production, 17 Mlbs 2025E), Kazatomprom (KAP, ~43% global share, 30 Mlbs 2025E)
   - **Mid-cap development**: NexGen (NXE, Rook II, 8.5 Mlbs production target), Denison Mines (DNN, Wheeler River multi-year ramp)
   - **Enrichment/fuel cycle**: Centrus Energy (LEU, HALEU production & LEU+ expansion); URENCO (URCYY, US/EU expansion)

3. **Thematic ETFs**: URNM (Global Uranium & Nuclear Components), URA (Sprott Uranium Miners ETF)

4. **Options/Derivatives**: Limited liquidity in listed uranium options; forwards and bilateral commodity swaps available through uranium trading desks (TradeTech, UxC, Numerco).

5. **Futures Contracts**: CME Group uranium futures (UX contract) provide leveraged, liquid price exposure; high leverage and mark-to-market risk suitable only for sophisticated, well-capitalized participants.

## B. Supply/Demand Fundamentals — The Nuclear Fuel Balance Sheet

### B1. Supply Architecture

**Primary Mine Production**: Global uranium mining produces ~140-145 Mlbs U3O8 annually (2025 actuals). Supply by region:

| Region | Share | Key Producers | 2025E Output (Mlbs) |
|--------|-------|---|---|
| Kazakhstan | 43% | Kazatomprom, Inkai JV (Cameco), Mangystau | ~60 |
| Canada | 15% | Cameco (McArthur River, Cigar Lake) | ~20-22 |
| Namibia | 11% | Rossing (Orano/Swakop minority) | ~14-15 |
| Australia | 10% | ERA (Ranger, Olympic Dam), Heathgate (Beverley) | ~13-14 |
| Uzbekistan | 5% | UMSC (state) | ~7 |
| Niger | 4% | SOMAIR, COMINAK (state/Areva) | ~5-6 |
| Other (USA, Brazil, Russia) | 12% | Various | ~15-20 |
| **Global Total** | **100%** | — | **~140-145** |

**Supply Constraints & Production Cuts**: Despite tight fundamentals, primary production has contracted relative to demand:
- **Kazatomprom 2026 guidance**: Cut nominal production from 32,777 tU (9.1 Mlbs) to 29,697 tU (8.2 Mlbs)—a 10% reduction citing "insufficient supply-demand balance" to justify full capacity. Most cuts at JV Budenovskoye.
- **Cameco**: Maintained production targets near 17-18 Mlbs through strategic contracting and pricing discipline; McArthur River restart (2.5 Mlbs) remains delayed due to permitting and labor constraints.
- **Smaller producers**: Many (ERA, Heathgate, Kazatomprom minorities) are delaying expansions pending long-term contract visibility at $100+/lb.

**Secondary Supply**:
- **Government stockpiles**: U.S. (LEU strategic reserve at ~27 Mlbs), Russia (~60+ Mlbs), UK (~35 Mlbs), France (~20 Mlbs). U.S. stockpile drawdowns are now limited to national security waivers; strategic reserve sales are unlikely to resume until 2028+ absent geopolitical crises.
- **Enrichment tails re-enrichment**: ~2-4 Mlbs annually; economically viable only when enrichment SWU prices exceed ~$200/SWU or spot uranium exceeds $120/lb.
- **Utility inventory drawdowns**: Historical, but declining as utilities maintain minimal coverage (3-6 months, down from 12-18 months in 2010s).

**Conversion & Enrichment Capacity Constraints**:
- **Conversion**: ~60 Mtonne U/year global capacity; currently under-utilized at ~50 Mtonne. However, near-term bottleneck risk if conversion costs rise or Orano Malvési experiences unplanned downtime.
- **Enrichment**: ~70 MSWUs/year global capacity, but severely concentrated in Russia (46%). U.S. reliance on Russian TENEX is being addressed:
  - **Centrus Energy**: Deployed AC100M centrifuge cascade; currently expanding LEU capacity (2.5-3 MSWUs/year by 2027) and HALEU production (900 kg produced to date; targeting 10+ metric tons by June 2026 per DOE Congressional directive).
  - **URENCO USA**: Securing capacity for LEU+ (5-10% enrichment) by mid-2026.
  - **Orano**: Expanding Georges Besse II facility.

### B2. Demand Decomposition

**Existing Reactor Fleet Demand**: ~440 operating reactors globally consume ~180 Mlbs U3O8 annually (68,900 tU). Demand is stable in developed markets but rising in Asia (China +8 GW/year, India +2 GW/year planned).

**New Reactor Construction**:
- **Under construction (60 units)**: ~8-10 GW additions; projected to add ~12-15 Mlbs annual consumption by 2030.
- **Planned (110 units)**: Advanced construction timelines, likely adding ~20-25 Mlbs by 2035.
- **Proposed (350+ units)**: Aspirational; many face financing, local opposition, or regulatory bottlenecks. Realistically, 50-100 units commissioned by 2050.

**SMR & Advanced Reactor Demand**:
- Small modular reactors (300-500 MW per unit) require HALEU (5-20% U-235) or LEU+ (5-10% U-235) rather than conventional LEU (3-5%).
- A 300 MW SMR consumes ~40-60 tU annually, but requires 2-3x the SWU commitment per unit of energy produced compared to large LWRs due to higher enrichment levels.
- **HALEU demand trajectory**: Currently minimal (900 kg produced); DOE targets 10 metric tons by June 2026 and 20-30 metric tons by 2030. By 2035, if 50-100 SMRs operate, HALEU demand could reach 100+ metric tons/year (equivalent to ~0.3-0.4 Mlbs primary uranium + 5-10 MSWUs enrichment).

**Contract vs. Spot Market Dynamics**:
- **Term market (multi-year contracts)**: Anchored at $75-85/lb throughout 2025; represents ~80% of utility procurement. Utilities lock in contracts 3-5 years ahead of fuel delivery to manage counterparty credit and fuel supply security.
- **Spot market**: Floated between $63-83/lb in 2025; broke through $100/lb in January 2026. Spot represents ~20% of transactions (traders, juniors, physical investors).
- **Backwardation shift**: Historically, term prices led spot (contango), signaling ample supply. In 2026, spot is rising faster than term, indicating near-term tightness. Investors see this as early-stage signal of contracting cycle acceleration.

**Utility Contracting Cycle Status**:
- Utilities maintain coverage targets of 8-10 years of fuel at reactor fuel load. Many U.S. utilities operated below minimum coverage in 2020-2024, deferring purchases as spot prices fell. As of February 2026, coverage is estimated at 6-8 years for average utilities, with aggressive procurement underway.
- Contracting volumes are expected to accelerate 30-50% in 2026-2027 as utilities layer in multi-year contracts at $95-110/lb, driving term price appreciation.

### B3. Inventory & Contracting Dynamics

**Utility Stockpiles**: Declining from historical 12-18 month norms to 3-6 months currently. A typical 1 GW LWR reactor requires ~200 tU per year. A utility operating 10 GW of capacity maintains ~500-1000 tU buffer. In aggregate, global utility working inventory is estimated at ~15-20 Mlbs, down 30-40% from 2010 levels.

**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust**: Inventory grew from ~66 Mlbs (late 2023) to ~78.4 Mlbs as of February 2026. Trust accumulation is driven by perceived supply deficit and retail investor uranium exposure demand. Trust holdings represent ~43% of current annual production—a meaningful inventory buffer that moderates short-term price spikes but also signals confidence in multi-year structural bull thesis.

**Yellow Cake PLC**: Holds ~25 Mlbs; smaller than Sprott but similarly bullish on uranium fundamentals. Holdings represent ~18% of annual production.

**Government Reserves**: Broadly off-market; unlikely to be released except under geopolitical stress or national security directives. Russia's uranium reserves are less relevant post-sanctions; Kazakhstan's national reserves are strategic and unavailable for sale.

**Inventory-Adjusted Supply/Demand Model**:
- **2025 balance**: ~140-145 Mlbs primary production + 15-20 Mlbs secondary supply + ~5-10 Mlbs utility inventory draw = ~160-175 Mlbs supply vs. ~180 Mlbs demand = **~5-20 Mlbs deficit** (covered by Sprott/Yellow Cake physical inventory accumulation and spot volatility).
- **2026-2030 trajectory**: With new reactor additions and AI data center demand, consumption projected to reach 190-210 Mlbs annually. Primary production remains constrained at ~140-150 Mlbs (absent major new mine development). Deficit widens to **25-50 Mlbs annually**, exerting sustained upward pressure on prices and term contract terms.
- **Secondary supply decline**: As enrichment tails deplete and government stockpiles remain protected, secondary supply could fall to 10-15 Mlbs by 2030, tightening the deficit further.

## C. Macro Regime & Policy Driver Analysis

### C1. Energy Policy & Nuclear Renaissance

**COP28 Declaration (November 2023, operationalized 2026)**:
- 25+ nations pledged to **triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050** (from ~370 GW to ~1,100 GW equivalent).
- Implies ~20 GW/year average new nuclear additions, vs. historical 3-5 GW/year. Requires accelerated project finance, supply chain investment, and regulatory harmonization.
- **Uranium consumption implication**: Tripling capacity implies ~60% increase in fuel demand by 2050. Near-term (2026-2030) impact is modest (+5-10 Mlbs/year), but medium-term (2030-2040) impact is substantial (+40-60 Mlbs/year).

**U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, 2022-2032)**:
- $369B allocated to climate and clean energy, including ~$30B in direct nuclear production tax credits (PTC) and investment tax credits (ITC).
- **Existing fleet support**: $3/MWh production tax credit through 2032 for existing nuclear, securing financial viability of 99 GW of capacity through the 2030s.
- **New reactor support**: 30% ITC for new reactor construction; anticipated 20 new reactors + 3 restarts by 2045, adding ~12.5 Mlbs annual uranium demand once online (2028-2035 ramp).
- **Fuel cycle support**: Direct grants and loans for domestic uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, and fuel fabrication capacity expansion (Centrus $2.7B task order award).

**ADVANCE Act** (Advanced Nuclear Challenges Reactor Demonstration, pending final passage):
- Designed to streamline SMR and advanced reactor licensing, reduce regulatory delays, and enable risk-sharing between DOE and private developers.
- Directly enables deployment of next-generation reactors (X-Energy, TerraPower, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, NuScale, etc.), many of which require HALEU or specialized fuel forms.
- **Uranium impact**: Modest near-term (SMRs represent <1% of fleet by 2030), but catalytic for HALEU demand and long-term fuel cycle capacity investment.

**U.S. Domestic Enrichment Strategy**:
- **Russian LEU ban**: Prohibition effective January 1, 2028, with a 3-year phase-down (2025-2027) and national security waivers through 2027. U.S. utilities currently source ~27% of enrichment services from Russian TENEX.
- **Centrus Task Orders**: $2.7B DOE awards to Centrus, General Atomics, and Orano to expand domestic LEU and HALEU capacity over 10 years. Centrus specifically targeting 3+ MSWUs LEU production and 20+ metric tons HALEU by 2030.
- **URENCO USA Expansion**: 15% capacity increase by mid-2027; LEU+ production (5-10% enrichment) ramping mid-2026.
- **Net effect**: By 2028, U.S. domestic enrichment capacity capable of supplying 50-60% of U.S. LEU requirements and 80%+ of HALEU needs. Geopolitical de-risking and supply chain redundancy reduce Russian dependency risk significantly.

### C2. Geopolitical & Supply Chain Risk

**Russia Dependency & Sanctions Risk**:
- **Current exposure**: Rosatom/TENEX supplies 27% of U.S. enriched uranium, 46% of global enrichment capacity, 5-6% of global uranium mining (largely from Kazakhstan operations or Central Asian sourcing).
- **LEU ban mechanism**: U.S. ban effective 2028 with waivers through 2027. EU is debating similar restrictions (less stringent, likely allowing limited Russian LEU through 2030).
- **Mitigation timeline**: Domestic enrichment capacity ramps 2026-2028. By 2028-2029, U.S. domestic LEU production + URENCO USA capacity + Orano can theoretically cover U.S. LWR needs. Gap filled by contract stockpiling 2025-2027 and modest utility inventory drawdown.
- **Global enrichment bottleneck risk**: Outside U.S., Russian TENEX is the marginal supplier for enrichment services. Global enrichment capacity is tight; abrupt Russian ban (vs. phased transition) could create acute SWU price spikes ($300+/SWU) and delivery delays. This risk is mitigated by phased 2025-2028 transition and DOE capacity investment.

**Kazakhstan Alignment & Geopolitical Risk**:
- **Production share**: 43% of global uranium mining; largest single supplier.
- **Political risk**: 2022 civil unrest and 2024 election demonstrated internal instability. China and Russia are primary security/economic partners; western investment is tolerated but secondary.
- **2026 dynamics**: Kazatomprom's 10% production cut reflects cautious posture; capacity exists to scale back rapidly if domestic fuel needs rise or geopolitical pressure increases. Alternatively, if western demand signals are credible, re-acceleration is feasible within 12-18 months.
- **Mitigation for investors**: Diversification into Canadian (Cameco) and Australian (ERA) production; support for NexGen, Denison in Canada provides supply resilience.

**Niger Coup Impact (2023)**:
- Niger's SOMAIR and COMINAK operations produce ~5-6 Mlbs (4% global share). 2023 coup led to French military withdrawal and implicit threat to AREVA/Orano operations.
- **2026 status**: Orano is negotiating terms with Niger military junta. Operations remain curtailed at ~50% capacity. Long-term outlook uncertain; potential for further disruption or gradual normalization.
- **Market impact**: 3-5 Mlbs supply loss is absorbed by current deficit dynamics and inventory draws; not a primary driver of 2026 pricing, but contributes to structural tightness.

**Cobre Panama Parallel**:
- Analogy: Panama contract renegotiation/termination risk in mining (copper) demonstrates sovereign risk in resource-rich developing economies. Uranium faces similar risks in Kazakhstan (though lower political volatility than Latin America), Niger (demonstrated risk), and Uzbekistan.
- **Investors should monitor**: Contract stability, government relationships, foreign exchange exposure, and local labor costs as production cost curve dynamics shift.

**Western Supply Chain Rebuilding**:
- **Strategic stockpiling**: U.S. and European governments are quietly accumulating uranium inventory (reported 2024-2025 purchases by DOE and private companies). Strategic reserve concept has been revived in U.S. legislation.
- **Domestic mining revival**: U.S. uranium mining (Energy Fuels, Ur-Energy) receiving government contracts and loan support. Production remains modest (<1 Mlbs/year), but symbolic of western supply chain prioritization.
- **Investment framework**: Governments are de facto endorsing uranium supply chain investment via IRA, ADVANCE Act, and strategic reserve concepts. This signals 10-15 year confidence in uranium demand and structural underproduction.

### C3. Technology & Reactor Evolution

**Generation III+ Fleet**:
- Current fleet is predominantly Generation II reactors (built 1970s-2000s). Maintenance and uprate programs (U.S. 20% power uprates) extend life to 80-100 years, increasing fuel consumption modestly.
- **New Gen III+ reactors** (EPR, AP1000, Hualong One, etc.) are more efficient per unit of thermal output; consume slightly less uranium per GWh but are larger (1.0-1.6 GW vs. 0.8-1.0 GW average).
- **Net effect**: New construction is roughly U-neutral per GWh; fuel demand scales with deployed GW.

**SMR Deployment**:
- Small modular reactors (NuScale, X-Energy, TerraPower) are nearing commercialization (2027-2030 target deployment).
- **Early units**: ~100-300 MW scale; expensive per unit output ($10-15B/project). Viable for remote locations (mining, industrial heat) and grid resilience (distributed generation).
- **HALEU requirement**: Most SMRs require 5-20% enriched uranium vs. 3-5% for LWRs. A 300 MW SMR requires ~0.04 Mlbs primary uranium + ~1.5 MSWUs enrichment. Scaled to 100 GW SMR capacity (aspiration by 2050), demand is ~1.3 Mlbs uranium + 50 MSWUs enrichment—meaningful but not dominant.
- **Cost and scalability**: SMRs remain uneconomical at current capital costs; subsidy-dependent (IRA/ADVANCE Act). Deployment contingent on policy support and standardization, which is advancing but uncertain.

**Advanced/Gen IV Reactors** (Fast Breeder, Molten Salt, High-Temperature Gas):
- Mostly pre-commercial (2030s+). Fuel cycle integration is complex:
  - **Fast breeders** (e.g., China CFR-600): Operate on uranium and plutonium mixed oxide (MOX); capable of breeding new fuel from depleted uranium. Economically unproven and politically sensitive.
  - **Molten salt reactors** (e.g., Kairos, Terrestrial Energy): Can utilize thorium or recycled spent fuel; HALEU-compatible. Early-stage; first commercial units anticipated 2028-2032.
  - **High-temperature reactors**: Use TRISO particles (uranium kernel in graphite); inherently safe. No commercial units currently; PBMR program in South Africa abandoned in 2010s.
- **Uranium demand impact**: Minimal through 2030; speculative 2030-2050. Advanced reactor fuel requirements are diverse; no single commodity bottleneck.

**Fusion Timeline** (as context):
- Commercial fusion remains 20-30 years away per most credible assessments (2045-2055). Deuterium-tritium fusion is fuel source; uranium is irrelevant to fusion fuel cycles. Fusion is not material to uranium demand thesis through 2050.

## D. Financial Logic & Valuation

### Marginal Cost of Production Analysis

**Cost Curve Hierarchy**:
Uranium mining costs follow a conventional commodity cost curve, with marginal producers setting the price floor and inframarginal producers capturing economic rent.

| Tier | Producers | AISC (Est. 2026) | Notes |
|------|-----------|---|---|
| Ultra-low cost | Kazakhstan (ISL, brownfield) | $20-30/lb | Kazatomprom Budenovskoye, Mangystau; benefit from infrastructure & government subsidy |
| Low cost | Canada (underground, established) | $35-45/lb | Cameco Cigar Lake, McArthur River (pre-restart); skilled labor, infrastructure |
| Mid-cost | Australia (open pit), Namibia | $50-70/lb | ERA Ranger/Olympic Dam; Rossing (Orano); permitting overhead |
| Marginal cost | US, Brazil, new projects | $70-100/lb | Ur-Energy, Energy Fuels, greenfield development |
| High-cost | Tertiary/explorers, re-enrichment | $100-150/lb | Feasible only if spot uranium >$110/lb or SWU >$200 |

**Implications**:
- At $90-100/lb spot, only 60-70% of global production is economically viable at AISC.
- Kazatomprom's 10% 2026 production cut is rational: operating at $100/lb spot, marginal contribution on capacity exceeds mine-gate cost but is insufficient to justify capital investment or risk-taking.
- At $120+/lb, majority of production (85-90%) is economically viable, incentivizing restart of Canadian mines (McArthur River), U.S. production ramps (Ur-Energy, Energy Fuels), and exploratory development of NexGen (Rook II, 8.5 Mlbs potential) and Denison (Wheeler River, 5+ Mlbs potential).

### Replacement Cost Analysis

**Replacement cost for uranium** is the full cost to develop and operate a new mine to replace retired or sub-threshold capacity. This includes:
- Pre-development (5-7 years, $50-100M): exploration, permitting, feasibility studies.
- Construction (3-5 years, $200-500M+): mine development, mill, infrastructure.
- Operating cost (lifecycle 20-30 years): all-in sustaining cost plus depreciation, corporate overhead, taxes.

**Net present value** of a new uranium mine at $100/lb uranium + $150/SWU enrichment is typically positive for deposits >5 Mlbs reserves with AISC <$60/lb. At $80/lb uranium, NPV turns negative for all but the lowest-cost deposits.

**Replacement cost = "fair value" thesis**:
- Goldman Sachs and other uranium analysts posit replacement cost of uranium supply at $100-120/lb, implying:
  - At current spot of ~$100/lb, there is zero economic incentive to develop new capacity.
  - Prices must remain >$100/lb for 3-5 years to justify capex and de-risk development.
  - Structural supply deficit will self-correct upward in price, enabling 2-3 new major mines by 2030-2035 (NexGen, Denison, Kazatomprom expansion).

### Contract Price vs. Spot Price: The Tale of Two Markets

**Spot Market ($100/lb, Feb 2026)**:
- Represents ~20% of uranium transactions.
- Driven by near-term supply/demand mismatches, physical investor positioning (Sprott accumulation), and speculative leverage.
- Highly volatile; swing of $10-20/lb within months is common.
- Marginal physical supply is constrained; any demand surge pushes spot sharply higher.

**Term Market ($75-85/lb, multi-year contracts)**:
- Represents ~80% of utility procurement.
- Reflects "normalized" cost of long-cycle production and utility budget caps.
- Slower-moving; typically 6-12 month lag behind spot price discovery.
- Anchored by contracting cycle discipline; utilities avoid front-running and prefer averaged pricing.

**Historical contango (term > spot) indicates ample supply; backwardation (spot > term) indicates tightness.**
- 2024-2025: Strong contango ($63-83 spot, $75-85 term); suppressed demand, ample inventory.
- Q4 2025-Q1 2026: Spot break-through ($90-100/lb), term rising slowly ($78-88/lb); early-stage backwardation forming.
- **2026-2027 outlook**: As utilities accelerate contracting and new reactor additions become visible, term prices likely rise to $100-120/lb. Spot could trade ahead at $120-140/lb in surge scenarios.

### Historical Price Regime Analysis

| Period | Avg Spot Price | Policy/Demand Drivers | Outcome |
|--------|---|---|---|
| 2003-2007 | $20-50/lb | Reactor uprates, China nuclear expansion | Supply deficit, run-up to $140/lb (2007) |
| 2008-2016 | $40-80/lb | Post-Fukushima moratorium, supply oversupply | Prolonged bear market; capacity closures |
| 2017-2020 | $20-40/lb | Fukushima tail-off, minimal new demand | Uranium "death spiral" narrative; Cameco/ERA consolidation |
| 2021-2023 | $30-75/lb | Policy revival (IRA 2022), spot accumulation | Supply deficit narrative reemerges |
| 2024-2025 | $63-100/lb | COP28, AI data center demand, Russian ban anticipation | Spot strength; term lagging |
| 2026-2027E | $100-130/lb | Utility contracting cycle, new reactor orders, HALEU demand | Term/spot convergence at higher level |

**Pattern observation**: Uranium undergoes 8-10 year boom-bust cycles, driven by reactors additions (lumpy, 5-10 year lead times) and sentiment swings (supply overshoot/undershoot). Current cycle (2020s-2030s) is longer than historical norms due to policy clarity (COP28, IRA) reducing downside risk.

### Inventory-Adjusted Supply/Demand Model

**Simplified balance sheet approach**:

| Component | 2025 | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E | 2029E | 2030E |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Supply** | | | | | | |
| Primary mining | 145 | 140 | 145 | 150 | 160 | 170 |
| Secondary (tails re-enrich, gov't, recycling) | 20 | 18 | 18 | 15 | 15 | 15 |
| Utility inventory draw | 5 | 10 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total Supply** | **170** | **168** | **168** | **165** | **175** | **185** |
| **Demand** | | | | | | |
| Operating reactors (440 units) | 180 | 182 | 185 | 187 | 190 | 192 |
| New reactor additions (GW to lbs) | — | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| **Total Demand** | **180** | **187** | **195** | **202** | **210** | **217** |
| **Net Balance** | -10 | -19 | -27 | -37 | -35 | -32 |
| **Deficit Resolution** | Sprott/physical stock | Sprott draw-down, price rise | Term price rise, mine expansion | New mines online (NexGen, Denison), price plateaus | Steady state | Steady state |

**Key assumptions**:
- Primary mining ramps modestly (2-3% annually) as prices support new projects.
- New reactor additions scale from 5 Mlbs (2026) to 25 Mlbs (2030) as projects move to operation.
- Sprott Trust is reserve buffer, capable of absorbing 3-5 years of deficits before exhausting inventory.

**Valuation implications**:
- **2026-2028**: Deficits are manageable via Sprott draw-down and term price rises. No acute supply crisis.
- **2028-2032**: Deficits widen; term prices reach $100-120/lb by 2028, enabling NexGen (2029-2031) and Denison (2028-2030) ramps.
- **2032-2040**: New supply additions stabilize deficit; term prices likely plateau $90-110/lb as marginal cost curve shifts down with new, lower-cost supply online.

### Positioning-Based Analysis

**Current market positioning** (February 2026):
- **Long positioning**: Sprott Trust accumulating at 78.4 Mlbs; option-adjusted corporate buyers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google data centers) entering long-term contracts; emerging market utilities committing to reactor orders.
- **Short positioning**: Minimal; uranium has no naked short-selling infrastructure or short bias.
- **Neutral/unhedged**: Kazatomprom, Cameco, URENCO managing hedges opportunistically; most production is unhedged or partially hedged.

**Positioning implies**:
- Upstream players (producers, explorers) have structural incentive to maintain supply discipline (withhold production at <$100/lb) to support prices.
- Downstream (utilities) have growing incentive to lock in term contracts to secure fuel supply and budget certainty.
- Physical investors (Sprott) are signaling confidence in $100+ equilibrium through continued accumulation.

## E. Pattern Matching & IDP Flagging

The eight Investment Decision Patterns (IDPs) from the uranium prompt are examined below:

> **IDP: Deficit-Driven Structural Repricing**
>
> The uranium market exhibits a classic supply-deficit signature: primary production (140-145 Mlbs) is 20-30% below demonstrated demand (180+ Mlbs), with secondary supply declining over time. Deficits are currently absorbed by Sprott/Yellow Cake physical accumulation (78.4 Mlbs trust inventory = 6 months global production). This dynamic is mathematically unsustainable beyond 2027-2028. Historical precedent (2003-2007 uranium bull run from $20 to $140/lb) occurred under similar deficit conditions. Current pricing at $100/lb has only partially corrected; replacement cost analysis suggests $100-120/lb is "fair value" to incentivize supply expansion. Pattern strength: **HIGH**.

> **IDP: Policy-Driven Demand Acceleration (COP28 & IRA Codification)**
>
> Nuclear energy has transitioned from energy-source-du-jour to systemic climate and energy security policy. COP28's tripling pledge (endorsed by 25+ nations) and U.S. IRA's $30B+ nuclear support represent multi-decade policy commitment, not transient subsidies. This differs from 2010s-era subsidies, which were vulnerable to political reversals. Probability that COP28/IRA pledges are sustained through 2035 is >90% (bipartisan support, geopolitical alignment). New reactor additions are accelerating from 3-5 GW/year (historical) to 8-12 GW/year (2025-2030 projection). Each GW of new reactor adds 0.5-0.7 Mlbs annual uranium demand. Pattern strength: **HIGH**.

> **IDP: Geopolitical Supply Chain De-Risking as Price Support**
>
> Russian LEU ban (effective 2028) removes 27% of U.S. enriched uranium supply but is not a supply shock—it's a 3-year phased transition (2025-2028) with policy-mandated domestic capacity expansion (DOE $2.7B Centrus/URENCO/Orano task orders). Kazakhstan remains 43% of global supply but is geopolitically unaligned with the west (Russia/China orbit). This creates sovereign risk premium in uranium pricing; investors demand $100+ uranium to justify supply diversification into Canada, Australia, U.S. domestically. Pattern strength: **MODERATE-HIGH**. (Risk: geopolitical détente or Russia sanctions reversal could deflate this premium.)

> **IDP: AI/Data Center Demand Optionality (Upside Tail)**
>
> Microsoft (Constellation/Three Mile Island, 835 MW, 20-year PPA), Amazon (Talen/Susquehanna, 1,920 MW PPA), Google (Kairos 500 MW SMR fleet), Meta (Clinton, 1.1 GW)—combined, these PPAs represent ~4.25 GW of incremental demand by 2028-2032. Data center energy demand is projected to triple by 2030 (current ~3-5% of U.S. grid, targeting 10%+ by 2035). Not all data centers will adopt nuclear (many are pursuing solar/wind), but even 30-50% adoption implies 100-150 GW of additional nuclear capacity by 2040—equivalent to tripling current fleet. This is **upside tail risk** to uranium demand models and is poorly priced into current forecasts. Probability of 100+ GW data center nuclear by 2040: ~40-60%. Pattern strength: **MODERATE** (high optionality but execution risk is substantial).

> **IDP: Enrichment Bottleneck as Secondary Constraint**
>
> While uranium supply is deficit-driven, enrichment capacity is even more constrained. Global enrichment capacity (~70 MSWUs/year) supports current 180 Mlbs uranium demand only barely; new reactor additions and HALEU demand require 5-10 MSWUs incremental capacity per 1 GW of new reactors. Russian TENEX (46% global capacity) is being phased out by 2028; domestic U.S. capacity is expanding from ~3 MSWUs to 5-7 MSWUs by 2030, but this leaves a gap. URENCO (30% global) is expanding modestly; Orano (10%) is capacity-constrained by French nuclear supply chain. **SWU pricing is likely to spike 50-100% above spot uranium gains** as enrichment becomes the marginal constraint by 2028-2030. This benefits Centrus LEU and HALEU producers. Pattern strength: **HIGH**.

> **IDP: Inventory Accumulation as Contrarian Signal**
>
> Sprott Physical Uranium Trust has accumulated 78.4 Mlbs U3O8 (43% of annual production) between 2023-2026 despite volatile spot prices. Historically, such accumulation precedes major bull markets (precedent: 2003-2007 physical accumulation by hedge funds before $140/lb peak). Sprott's "money manager" strategy is contrarian: when others are fearful, accumulate. Current accumulation pattern suggests insider or institutional confidence in $120-150/lb uranium by 2027-2028. Pattern strength: **MODERATE** (accumulation is real, but Sprott may be capturing only 30-50% of upside if spot achieves $150+/lb, limiting leverage advantage).

> **IDP: Term Price Lagging Spot as Early Cycle Signal**
>
> Uranium market is transitioning from **contango** (term > spot, ample supply signal) to **backwardation** (spot > term, tight supply signal). In February 2026, spot is $100/lb while term remains $75-85/lb—15-20 percentage point gap. Historically, this divergence signals early-stage contracting cycle acceleration; utilities are forced to pay spot premiums to lock in forward supply. Within 12-18 months (mid-2027), term prices typically converge to spot or exceed it. This pattern is **prognostic**: if backwardation persists and widens through 2026-2027, it implies term prices will rise to $110-130/lb by 2028. Pattern strength: **HIGH** (well-documented commodity cycle).

> **IDP: SMR/HALEU Demand Validation as Long Cycle Confirmation**
>
> Centrus has produced 900 kg HALEU (Congressional target of 10 metric tons by June 2026 implies 11x current production ramp required). DOE-mandated 21 metric tons HALEU by 2026 end-of-year represents aggressive capacity scaling. If achieved, this validates demand from early SMR deployments (NuScale, X-Energy planning 2027-2030 operations). HALEU demand is marginal to total uranium (20-30 metric tons = 0.05-0.08 Mlbs uranium equivalent) but is high-margin enrichment service business. First SMR units coming online 2028-2030 will require 5-10 MSWUs enrichment per unit—providing validation of advanced reactor demand thesis and justifying long-cycle capital investment in enrichment capacity. Pattern strength: **MODERATE** (early-stage; validation still pending).

## F. Investigation Tracks & Verification

Investors should conduct the following due diligence to validate the uranium thesis and identify tail risks:

### Track 1: Fuel Cycle Supply Chain Mapping

**Action items**:
1. **Uranium mining capacity audit**: Verify primary production capacity and AISC cost curves with company investor relations and third-party agencies (World Nuclear Association, IAEA). Validate Kazatomprom 10% 2026 production cut and McArthur River restart timeline.
2. **Conversion capacity verification**: Contact Cameco, Honeywell, Converdyn to confirm conversion throughput and pricing. Validate no bottlenecks in UF6 production.
3. **Enrichment capacity and SWU pricing**: Monitor UxC and TradeTech SWU spot prices weekly; confirm URENCO USA and Centrus production ramps are on schedule per DOE reports. Validate no Russian dependency escalation.
4. **Secondary supply scrutiny**: Obtain latest U.S. DOE uranium reserve inventory reports; assess utility stockpile levels via SEC 10-Ks (utilities must disclose fuel inventory). Estimate tails re-enrichment economics at current SWU prices.

**Risk to thesis**: If AISC curve is steeper than assumed (suggesting higher price support), thesis is reinforced. If conversion or enrichment becomes constraining before uranium supply, thesis is partially invalidated (prices are bid up due to enrichment shortage, not uranium shortage).

### Track 2: Utility Contracting Cycle Verification

**Action items**:
1. **Utility SEC filings**: Monitor quarterly 10-Q and annual 10-K disclosures of large utilities (Duke Energy, Exelon, NextEra, Southern Company, EDF) for uranium procurement disclosures and fuel inventory metrics.
2. **Analyst call transcripts**: Search quarterly earnings calls for uranium/fuel supply commentary. Track if utilities are accelerating procurement or deferring (leading indicator of contracting cycle).
3. **Supplier announcements**: Monitor Cameco, Kazatomprom, SRUUF, NXE, DNN press releases for contract wins and pricing signals. Validate term price discovery.
4. **Physics of coverage**: Calculate utility fuel coverage ratios (inventory in months of consumption). Target is 8-10 years; if utilities are below 6-8 years, procurement urgency is high.

**Risk to thesis**: If utilities announce large forward-looking contracts below $90/lb, thesis is invalidated (supply not as tight as feared). If utilities extend coverage to 10+ years at $80-90/lb, contracting cycle is not accelerating (thesis is priced but not active).

### Track 3: Reactor Pipeline Reality Check

**Action items**:
1. **IAEA reactor database**: Cross-check World Nuclear Association and IAEA reported reactor construction pipeline (60 under construction, 110 planned, 350 proposed). Verify not all proposed units are realistic; filter based on financing, permitting, and political feasibility.
2. **New reactor timing**: Contact NuScale, TerraPower, X-Energy for SMR deployment timelines. Confirm first commercial units are 2028-2032 (not earlier); validate HALEU demand ramp.
3. **Regional demand assessment**: China, India, UAE are drivers of new reactor deployment. Monitor their nuclear expansion policy announcements; track construction progress via satellite imagery (World Nuclear News, IAEA reports).
4. **Retirement and uprates**: Track U.S. nuclear fleet retirements (announced: Palisades 2030, Diablo Canyon extended to 2030s, Indian Point closure 2025). Net effect is modest (20-30 MW equivalent retirements offset by uprates and life extensions).

**Risk to thesis**: If reactor pipeline decelerates due to financing constraints or public opposition (especially in EU), uranium demand growth is lower than modeled (+5-10 Mlbs vs. +25 Mlbs projected). This would delay term price recovery and potentially invalidate the $100-120/lb structural pricing thesis.

---

## G. Bear Case & Risk Scenarios

While the uranium bull case is substantive, material bear scenarios exist:

### **Bear Scenario 1: Accelerated Secondary Supply or Strategic Reserve Drawdown**
- **Trigger**: U.S. or EU government decides to drawdown strategic uranium reserves to dampen price inflation or support utilities.
- **Impact**: 10-15 Mlbs incremental supply (U.S. strategic reserve) or 20-30 Mlbs (Russia, if sanctions are lifted). This could suppress spot uranium for 2-3 years to $60-80/lb.
- **Probability**: ~15-20% (low; geopolitical normalization with Russia is unlikely near-term, and governments are reluctant to deplete strategic reserves).

### **Bear Scenario 2: Renewable Energy Competitiveness Reduction in Nuclear**
- **Trigger**: Solar and wind costs continue to decline below nuclear cost-of-generation; utilities pivot to renewables + storage instead of new nuclear builds.
- **Impact**: New reactor pipeline stalls; demand growth plateaus at 180-190 Mlbs (no new construction increments). Uranium prices flatten at $70-90/lb.
- **Probability**: ~25-30% (moderate; however, grid decarbonization at scale requires both nuclear and renewables; neither alone is sufficient).

### **Bear Scenario 3: Major Reactor Safety Incident or Fukushima-Scale Disaster**
- **Trigger**: Terrorism, accident, or environmental contamination at operating reactor.
- **Impact**: Nuclear sentiment collapses; COP28 pledges are deprioritized; new reactor orders halt. Existing fleet under political pressure for closure. Uranium demand falls to 100-120 Mlbs (existing fleet only, minimal new builds). Prices collapse to $20-40/lb within 6-12 months.
- **Probability**: ~10-15% (low-to-moderate; regulatory standards have improved since Fukushima; advanced reactor designs have passive safety).

### **Bear Scenario 4: Rapid SMR/Advanced Reactor Commercialization Disappointment**
- **Trigger**: First commercial SMRs (NuScale, TerraPower) exceed capex projections by 50%+, fail to achieve economies of scale, or underperform operationally.
- **Impact**: Advanced reactor orders collapse; HALEU demand never materializes; only conventional LWR demand sustains (no upside from SMRs). Uranium demand grows modestly (+5-10 Mlbs by 2030, not +30 Mlbs as bull case assumes).
- **Probability**: ~35-45% (moderate-to-high; SMR capex and O&M are unproven at scale).

### **Bull Tail Risk: Data Center Nuclear Adoption Exceeds 50% of New Capacity**
- **Trigger**: Tech giants (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta) aggressively substitute nuclear PPAs for wind/solar; other data center operators follow trend.
- **Impact**: Uranium demand accelerates to 220-250 Mlbs by 2035 (vs. 210 Mlbs baseline). Deficits widen; uranium prices achieve $150-180/lb by 2030-2032.
- **Probability**: ~20-25% (moderate-to-low; requires both tech adoption and regulatory enablement).

## H. Valuation & Price Targets

### Spot Uranium Price Forecasts

Based on supply-demand modeling, replacement cost analysis, and investor positioning:

| Period | Bear Case | Base Case | Bull Case | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **2026 (current)** | $85-95/lb | $100-110/lb | $120-135/lb | Spot at $100/lb; backwardation forming; term prices lagging |
| **2027** | $80-90/lb | $110-125/lb | $140-160/lb | Utility contracting cycle accelerates; term prices converge to spot |
| **2028** | $70-85/lb | $100-115/lb | $150-180/lb | New reactor additions visible; Russian LEU ban effective; enrichment SWU spikes |
| **2029** | $60-75/lb | $95-110/lb | $140-170/lb | NexGen (Rook II) production ramp possible; deficits persist; steady-state pricing |
| **2030+** | $50-70/lb | $85-105/lb | $120-140/lb | New supply online (NexGen, Denison); deficits narrow; prices normalize |

**Base case rationale**: Uranium prices oscillate $95-115/lb over 2026-2030 as supply-demand equilibrates incrementally. Term prices lead spot higher by 12-18 months; peaks occur when contracting cycles peak (typically 2027-2028). By 2030, new supply from NexGen, Denison, and Kazatomprom ramp narrows the deficit; prices stabilize $85-105/lb as marginal cost curve shifts.

### Term Price Recovery Timeline

- **Q1 2026**: Term prices begin rising from $75-80/lb as spot at $100/lb creates backwardation.
- **Q2-Q4 2026**: Term prices reach $90-100/lb as utilities lock in first tranche of forward contracts.
- **2027**: Term prices accelerate to $110-125/lb as full-cycle utility procurement acceleration is visible.
- **2028**: Term prices plateau $100-120/lb as new reactor construction becomes operationally visible and Sprott inventory stabilizes.

### Enrichment (SWU) Price Outlook

SWU pricing is secondary to uranium but is high-leverage:

| Period | Bear ($/SWU) | Base ($/SWU) | Bull ($/SWU) |
|--------|---|---|---|
| 2026 | $130-160 | $150-180 | $200-250 |
| 2027 | $120-150 | $170-200 | $250-300 |
| 2028 | $110-140 | $180-220 | $280-350 |

**Rationale**: As uranium supply tightens, enrichment becomes marginal constraint. Centrus and URENCO benefit from SWU price appreciation as much as from uranium appreciation. Current contracted SWU prices are $120-150/SWU; spot is higher. By 2028, SWU prices could exceed uranium as the binding constraint on fuel cost.

---

## I. Recommendation & Portfolio Positioning

### Thesis Summary

The uranium investment thesis is **POSITIVE** (2-3 year base case, 5+ year structural case):

1. **Supply deficit is structural and widening**: Primary production (140-145 Mlbs) is 20-30% below demand (180+ Mlbs). Deficits are currently absorbed by Sprott/physical inventory (78.4 Mlbs trust holdings) and inventory drawdowns, but this is unsustainable beyond 2027-2028.
2. **Demand is policy-driven and accelerating**: COP28 tripling pledge + IRA nuclear support represent multi-decade policy commitment. New reactor additions are ramping; AI data center demand is an upside option.
3. **Pricing is supported by replacement cost economics**: Uranium requires $100-120/lb to justify supply expansion capex. Current $100/lb spot is consistent with replacement cost; term prices ($75-85/lb) are artificially suppressed and will rise.
4. **Contracting cycle is early-stage but accelerating**: Backwardation (spot > term) is forming; utilities are beginning to lock in forward contracts. Historical precedent suggests term prices will rise to $110-130/lb over 12-18 months.
5. **Geopolitical tailwinds are supporting supply chain de-risking**: Russian LEU ban and domestic enrichment expansion create sovereign risk premium and supply chain redundancy incentives.

### Investment Vehicles & Recommendation

**For physical commodity exposure**:
- **Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SRUUF, U-UN.TO, U-U.TO)**: Direct physical uranium exposure; minimal expense ratio; recommended for 2-5 year holding.
- **Yellow Cake PLC (YCUK, LSE)**: Alternative physical vehicle; smaller ($1.5B AUM vs. $7.3B for Sprott); less liquid.

**For equity leverage**:
- **Cameco (CCJ)**: Large-cap producer; ~15% global market share; significant operational upside if uranium achieves $120+/lb (FCF leverage 3-5x). Dividend coverage is expanding.
- **Kazatomprom (KAP, not yet US-listed; available OTC)**: 43% global supply; lowest AISC costs; upside leverage to high uranium prices. Geopolitical risk requires position sizing discipline.
- **NexGen Energy (NXE)**: Pre-revenue explorer; Rook II project targets 8.5 Mlbs production by 2030. High leverage to $100+/lb uranium; expects positive NPV IRR >15% at $90/lb base case.
- **Denison Mines (DNN)**: Wheeler River project (5+ Mlbs potential). Similar profile to NexGen; slightly lower grade, longer development timeline.

**For enrichment exposure**:
- **Centrus Energy (LEU)**: Pure-play HALEU + LEU producer; DOE task order guarantees demand. Stock is highly leveraged to SWU price appreciation; 3-5 year volatility is high.
- **URENCO (private; URCYY ADR available)**: Established enricher; expanding U.S. capacity. Lower risk than Centrus but lower upside leverage.

**For thematic/diversified uranium exposure**:
- **URNM ETF (Global Uranium & Nuclear Components)**: Holds Cameco, NXE, DNN, Centrus, URENCO, and small-cap explorers. Recommended for investors seeking diversified uranium beta without single-stock risk.
- **URA ETF (Sprott Uranium Miners)**: Slightly more concentrated; primarily equity producers and developers.

### Position Sizing & Risk Management

1. **Core position (40-50% of uranium allocation)**: Physical uranium (Sprott, Yellow Cake) or Cameco (large-cap, dividend). 2-3 year holding; expect 50-100% nominal returns in base case.
2. **Growth position (30-40% of allocation)**: NexGen, Denison (explorers/developers). Higher volatility; 3-5 year horizon; 2-5x returns in bull case, -30-50% downside in bear case.
3. **Leverage position (10-20% of allocation)**: Centrus (enrichment leverage), small-cap explorers (0.5-2 Mlbs production). Tactical 12-24 month positioning; highest risk/reward.
4. **Hedging (optional, 0-10%)**: For investors with existing fossil fuel or energy commodity exposure, uranium provides diversification (uncorrelated with oil/gas). For leveraged positions, consider 5-10% gold or SPY hedge.

### Trigger Events & Monitoring

**Bullish triggers** (increase allocation):
- Spot uranium breaks $110/lb and holds for >2 weeks.
- Term contract prices rise to $95/lb.
- Major utility announces >1 Mlbs forward uranium contracts at $100+/lb.
- Centrus delivers >1 metric ton HALEU to DOE.
- NexGen or Denison achieves final permitting for production ramp.

**Bearish triggers** (reduce allocation):
- Spot uranium falls below $85/lb and closes below $90/lb for >1 month.
- Term contract prices collapse below $70/lb.
- Major reactor project (SMR, Generation III+) is canceled or indefinitely delayed.
- Geopolitical detente with Russia leads to LEU ban waiver extension.
- New reactor orders decline materially (>30%) from current trajectory.

---

## Conclusion

Uranium markets in February 2026 are at the threshold of a structural repricing event. The combination of supply deficits, policy-driven demand acceleration, replacement cost economics, contracting cycle acceleration, and early-stage geopolitical de-risking creates a constructive medium-term outlook for uranium prices ($100-130/lb by 2027-2028 base case) and significant leverage for equity exposure (Cameco, NexGen, Denison, Centrus).

The thesis is not without risk. Secondary supply, renewable energy competition, safety incidents, or SMR commercialization disappointment could materially reduce demand or accelerate supply, pushing prices below $80/lb. However, the base case probability of sustained $95-115/lb uranium pricing through 2030 is >65%, with bull case upside (spot >$120/lb, term >$110/lb) at ~40% probability.

**Final recommendation: OVERWEIGHT uranium allocation, with 2-3 year time horizon and quarterly position rebalancing based on spot price, term price, and utility contracting cycle signals.**
