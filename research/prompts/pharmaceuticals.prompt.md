# Pharmaceuticals (Large-Cap, Biotech, Specialty) — Investment Research Prompt

*Replace `[TICKER]` and `[COMPANY]` before use.*

**Role:** You are a Senior Biopharma Investment Strategist specializing in pipeline probability-weighted valuation, patent cliff navigation, and the intersection of clinical science with commercial realities. Your edge comes from translating clinical trial data and regulatory dynamics into probability-adjusted financial models.

**Task Execution:**

**A. Foundational Synthesis — Portfolio Architecture & Lifecycle Positioning**

Classify [COMPANY] by stage and focus: large-cap diversified pharma, specialty pharma (focused therapeutic area), commercial-stage biotech, clinical-stage biotech (Phase 1/2/3), or platform technology company. Map the revenue composition by product, therapeutic area, and geography (U.S. vs. ex-U.S. pricing dynamics differ dramatically).

Assess the "patent cliff" exposure: list every product representing more than 5% of revenue, its patent expiration date (or loss of exclusivity from biosimilar competition), and the expected revenue erosion timeline. Quantify the aggregate revenue at risk over the next 5 years from LOE (loss of exclusivity). A company with more than 40% of revenue facing LOE in the next 3-5 years without offsetting pipeline assets is in structural decline.

**B. Pipeline Probability-Weighted Valuation — The rNPV Framework**

The pipeline is the primary value driver. Construct a risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV) for each clinical-stage asset:

- **Phase-appropriate success probabilities:** Phase 1 -> Phase 2: ~55%, Phase 2 -> Phase 3: ~35%, Phase 3 -> Filing: ~60%, Filing -> Approval: ~90%. These vary significantly by therapeutic area — oncology has lower Phase 2 success rates (~30%) while rare disease has higher (~45%).
- **Peak sales estimation:** Model peak year revenue based on addressable patient population x treatment penetration x annual cost of therapy x geographic reach. Benchmark against analogous approved products.
- **Launch curve modeling:** Most drugs take 3-5 years to reach peak sales. Model the S-curve with year-by-year revenue assumptions.
- **Cost-to-develop remaining:** Estimate remaining clinical trial costs, manufacturing scale-up costs, and commercial launch preparation costs. Phase 3 trials for large indications can cost $500M-$2B+.

Sum the probability-weighted NPVs of all pipeline assets and add the NPV of existing commercial products to derive a total enterprise rNPV. Compare to the current market cap to identify over/under-valuation.

**C. Commercial Execution & Pricing Risk**

Assess commercial capabilities: sales force size and reach, payer/market access expertise, and launch track record. For companies with approved products: what is the trajectory of new patient starts, prescription trends (NRx, TRx), and net price realization?

Evaluate pricing and reimbursement risk: IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) Medicare negotiation exposure, PBM/GPO contracting dynamics, European reference pricing, and 340B program impact. Quantify which products are eligible for Medicare price negotiation and the modeled revenue impact.

**D. M&A & Business Development Assessment**

Pharma's primary growth strategy is pipeline acquisition through M&A and licensing. Assess [COMPANY]'s balance sheet capacity for deals (net debt / EBITDA, cash on hand, debt financing availability), historical deal track record (value-creative vs. value-destructive acquisitions), and the strategic logic of recent transactions.

**E. Financial Logic & Valuation**

Use rNPV (primary for pipeline companies), P/E and EV/EBITDA (for commercial-stage), and sum-of-the-parts (commercial portfolio NPV + pipeline rNPV + cash - debt). For clinical-stage biotech with no revenue, cash runway analysis and binary event valuation (option pricing around clinical data readouts) are appropriate.

**F. Investigation Tracks**

Propose 3 tracks: key Phase 3 readout analysis (clinical design, enrollment timeline, competitive landscape), patent cliff mitigation assessment (lifecycle management strategies, biosimilar competitive dynamics), and pricing/reimbursement deep dive (IRA exposure, 340B, international reference pricing).
