# Drones (Commercial & Defense UAV) — Investment Research Prompt

*Replace `[TICKER]` and `[COMPANY]` before use.*

**Role:** You are a Senior Aerospace & Emerging Technology Strategist specializing in unmanned aerial systems. Your analytical framework bridges regulatory pathway analysis with defense procurement dynamics and commercial scalability economics.

**Task Execution:**

**A. Foundational Synthesis — Platform Classification & Strategic Positioning**

Classify [COMPANY]'s drone portfolio by platform type (Group 1-5 UAS classification by weight/altitude), mission profile (ISR, delivery, inspection, mapping, strike), and end market (defense/intelligence, commercial enterprise, consumer). This classification determines the regulatory pathway, competitive set, and revenue model entirely.

Assess whether [COMPANY] is a hardware-centric business (platform manufacturer), a software/data play (analytics layer on third-party hardware), or a vertically integrated operator (owns platforms and sells outcomes/data-as-a-service). The margin profiles differ dramatically: hardware margins are typically 25-40%, software margins are 60-80%, and outcome-based models can reach 50-70% at scale.

Map the founding team's background: defense/intelligence community origin (signals government contracting expertise), academic/robotics origin (signals technology depth but potential commercialization gap), or consumer tech origin (signals go-to-market strength but potential regulatory naivety).

**B. Regulatory Pathway as Competitive Moat**

The single most important variable for commercial drone companies is regulatory certification. Map [COMPANY]'s position on the following:

- **FAA Type Certification status:** Has the platform received or applied for Type Certificate? What stage (TC basis, means of compliance, flight testing)? This process takes 3-7 years and costs $50-200M, creating a massive barrier to entry once achieved.
- **BVLOS Waiver/Approval:** Beyond Visual Line of Sight authorization is the unlock for commercial scalability. Does [COMPANY] hold BVLOS waivers, and in how many jurisdictions? Are they site-specific or broad-area?
- **Remote ID compliance:** Is the platform compliant with FAA Remote ID requirements (mandatory since March 2024)?
- **International certifications:** EASA (EU), CAAC (China), DGCA (India) — each opens distinct markets with different competitive landscapes.
- **Defense authorization:** Does [COMPANY] appear on the DOD Blue UAS list (approved for government use)? NDAA Section 848 compliance status?

Quantify the regulatory moat: how many years and dollars separate [COMPANY] from its nearest competitor on the certification pathway?

**C. Defense Procurement & Commercial Scalability**

For defense-oriented companies: map the procurement pathway (R&D contract -> prototype -> LRIP -> FRP). Identify whether revenue comes from cost-plus development contracts (low margin, high visibility) or fixed-price production (higher margin, execution risk). Assess the total addressable market by mapping to specific Programs of Record and unfunded requirements in the DoD budget.

For commercial companies: analyze the unit economics of drone-as-a-service delivery. What is the cost per flight hour vs. the revenue per flight hour? What is the fleet utilization rate? How does the maintenance/replacement cycle affect per-unit economics? What is the customer acquisition cost for enterprise contracts?

Evaluate the dual-use potential: can commercial platforms be adapted for defense applications (and vice versa)? Companies that bridge both markets have diversification advantages but face ITAR/export control complexity.

**D. Technology & Supply Chain Assessment**

Assess key technology differentiators: autonomy level (manual/assisted/supervised/fully autonomous), sensor payload capabilities, endurance/range, SWAP-C profile (size, weight, power, cost). Evaluate supply chain dependencies, particularly on Chinese-manufactured components (DJI-equivalent risk) and semiconductor availability for onboard compute.

**E. Financial Logic & Valuation**

Most drone companies are pre-profit or early revenue. Use EV/Revenue for growth-stage, backlog/pipeline analysis for defense contractors, and scenario-based DCF anchored to regulatory milestone achievement probabilities.

**F. Investigation Tracks**

Propose 3 tracks: specific FAA certification timeline verification, defense budget line-item analysis for relevant programs, and competitive technology benchmarking (autonomy stack maturity, payload integration).
