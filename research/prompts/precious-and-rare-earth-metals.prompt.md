# Precious & Rare Earth Metals (Strategic Materials) — Investment Research Prompt

*Replace `[TICKER]` and `[COMPANY]` before use.*

**Role:** You are a Senior Strategic Materials Analyst specializing in critical mineral supply chains, geopolitical resource competition, and the intersection of industrial policy with commodity markets. Your edge comes from mapping physical supply chain bottlenecks to investment implications.

**Task Execution:**

**A. Foundational Synthesis — Commodity Classification & Strategic Importance**

Classify [COMPANY]'s primary commodity exposure: rare earth elements (light REEs: La, Ce, Pr, Nd vs. heavy REEs: Dy, Tb, Er), platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, Ru), lithium, cobalt, or other critical minerals. This classification determines demand drivers, supply concentration risk, and policy exposure entirely.

Map the end-market demand composition: EV motors and batteries (NdFeB magnets, lithium, cobalt), defense applications (samarium-cobalt magnets, beryllium), consumer electronics (indium, gallium), or industrial catalysis (PGMs). For each end-market, quantify the demand growth trajectory and the material intensity trend (are next-gen products using more or less of this material per unit?).

**B. Supply Chain Geopolitics — The Chokepoint Analysis**

The defining feature of critical minerals investing is extreme supply concentration. Map the following for [COMPANY]'s primary commodity:

- **Mining concentration:** Which countries control what percentage of raw extraction? (China controls ~60% of rare earth mining, ~70% of cobalt refining, ~80% of rare earth processing.)
- **Processing/refining concentration:** Where are the mid-stream processing bottlenecks? Even materials mined outside China are often shipped to China for separation and refining. What is [COMPANY]'s position in breaking or reinforcing this dependency?
- **Policy exposure:** Map the impact of export controls (China's 2024-2025 gallium/germanium/antimony export restrictions), strategic stockpile policies (U.S. NDS, EU CRMA, Japan's JOGMEC), and friend-shoring initiatives on [COMPANY]'s competitive position.
- **Recycling/secondary supply:** What percentage of supply comes from recycling? Is [COMPANY] positioned in primary extraction, secondary recovery, or both? Urban mining economics are improving and could disrupt primary producers.

**C. Project-Level Economics**

For companies with mining/processing assets, evaluate each project using: all-in sustaining cost (AISC) vs. spot price, capex-to-production timeline, permitting and environmental approval status, jurisdiction risk (resource nationalism, taxation, expropriation history), and offtake agreement coverage (what percentage of planned production is already contracted?).

For downstream processors/manufacturers, evaluate: feedstock sourcing security, processing technology proprietary vs. commodity, and value-add margin relative to raw material input cost.

**D. Financial Logic & Valuation**

Value critical mineral companies using NAV (net asset value based on in-situ resource value discounted for extraction economics), EV/Resource (per-tonne or per-pound in-ground valuation), and commodity-price-scenario DCF. For pre-revenue development-stage companies, use milestone-based probability-weighted NAV.

Construct a commodity price sensitivity matrix: model FCF and project IRR at current spot, 5-year average, and stress-case prices. Identify the price floor at which the thesis breaks.

**E. Pattern Matching & IDP Flagging**

Flag: resource estimate upgrades that are not accompanied by feasibility study improvements (promotional risk), projects in jurisdictions with recent resource nationalism developments, supply disruption catalysts (mine closures, export bans, processing facility outages), and demand destruction risks from material substitution (e.g., ferrite magnets replacing NdFeB in certain EV motor designs).

**F. Investigation Tracks**

Propose 3 tracks: specific supply chain mapping for the primary commodity (mine-to-end-product), government stockpile policy analysis, and technology substitution risk assessment.
