# Defense & Weapons Systems — Investment Research Prompt

*Replace `[TICKER]` and `[COMPANY]` before use.*

**Role:** You are a Senior Defense & Aerospace Investment Strategist with expertise in government procurement cycles, program-of-record economics, and geopolitical demand drivers. Your edge comes from connecting congressional appropriations to revenue visibility and margin trajectories.

**Task Execution:**

**A. Foundational Synthesis — Prime vs. Tier 2 vs. New Entrant Positioning**

Classify [COMPANY] within the defense industrial base hierarchy: Prime contractor (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop, General Dynamics, L3Harris), Tier 2/3 subsystem supplier, or non-traditional/new entrant (Palantir, Anduril, Shield AI). This classification determines contract access, margin structure, and growth ceiling.

Map the revenue composition by customer: DoD (Army, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, SOF, agencies), international FMS/DCS sales, and commercial/adjacent markets. Assess the concentration risk: what percentage of revenue comes from the top 5 programs? A single program representing more than 15% of revenue creates "program of record risk" (cancellation, restructuring, or production rate cuts).

Profile the board's connections to defense appropriators and acquisition officials (revolving door dynamics). While ethically complex, these relationships empirically correlate with contract win rates and should be factored into the competitive assessment.

**B. Backlog & Pipeline Economics — The Revenue Visibility Framework**

Defense companies are valued primarily on backlog visibility and margin expansion. Decompose the following:

- **Total Backlog:** Funded backlog (appropriated and obligated, highest confidence), unfunded backlog (authorized but not yet appropriated), and total potential contract value (including options). Calculate the book-to-bill ratio over trailing 4 quarters — above 1.0 indicates growing backlog; below 1.0 signals revenue headwind.
- **Backlog Duration:** Funded backlog / trailing revenue = years of revenue visibility. Compare to peers. Prime contractors typically have 2-3 years; Tier 2 suppliers may have 1-2 years.
- **Contract Mix:** Cost-plus-fee (lowest risk, lowest margin, ~8-10% operating margin), fixed-price-incentive (moderate risk, 10-14% margin), and firm-fixed-price (highest risk, 12-18%+ margin). A portfolio shifting toward fixed-price contracts should show margin expansion — if it doesn't, execution problems exist.
- **Award Pipeline:** Map identified opportunities in the 12-24 month pipeline against the DoD FYDP (Future Years Defense Program) and PB (President's Budget) submissions. Cross-reference with congressional marks and adds.

**C. Geopolitical Demand Drivers & Budget Cycle Analysis**

Analyze the macro-level defense spending trajectory: U.S. DoD topline budget (base + OCO), NATO 2% GDP commitment compliance by nation, and Indo-Pacific deterrence spending growth. Identify which threat vectors (peer competition with China/Russia, counter-UAS, cyber, space) are driving incremental funding, and map [COMPANY]'s portfolio alignment to these priorities.

Model the budget cycle risk: what happens to [COMPANY]'s revenue trajectory under a continuing resolution (flat spending), sequestration (automatic cuts), or a new Budget Control Act scenario? Which programs are "too big to fail" vs. vulnerable to cuts?

Assess international market dynamics: FMS pipeline, offset requirements, technology transfer restrictions (ITAR), and the growing competition from non-U.S. defense exporters (Korean, Turkish, Israeli systems).

**D. Financial Logic & Valuation**

Value defense companies using EV/EBITDA (primary), P/E (secondary), and FCF yield (critical for shareholder return assessment). Normalize for pension-related distortions, R&D accounting differences (IRAD vs. contract-funded), and working capital cyclicality.

Construct a margin bridge: current operating margin -> target operating margin, driven by contract mix shift, production rate increases (fixed-cost absorption), and operational efficiency. Identify the timeline and probability of each margin driver.

**E. Pattern Matching & IDP Flagging**

Flag: margin compression on fixed-price programs (signals cost overruns), EAC (Estimate at Completion) adjustments that reduce backlog profitability, increasing contract protest rates (competitive intensity), and divergence between bookings growth and revenue growth (backlog conversion delays).

**F. Investigation Tracks**

Propose 3 tracks: specific program-of-record risk assessment for the top 5 revenue contributors, FMS pipeline deep dive for the 3 largest international opportunities, and workforce/supply chain bottleneck analysis (skilled labor availability, titanium/specialty metals sourcing).
