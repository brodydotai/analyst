# ASPI — Compliance Scorecard
## February 2026

**Report:** `aspi.feb.md`
**Applicable Playbooks:** Fission Thesis (uranium-and-nuclear-fuel) + Strategic Materials (precious-and-rare-earth-metals)
**Note:** ASPI straddles two playbooks. Scored against both with weighted relevance.

## Fission Thesis Coverage (Nuclear Fuels Segment)

| Section | Required | Covered | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1. Fuel Cycle Classification | Classify position across mining/conversion/enrichment/fabrication | Partial | B | Enrichment stage well-covered. Mining/conversion/fabrication not ASPI's business — correctly scoped to enrichment only. |
| A2. Investment Vehicle Landscape | Map exposure vehicles | Partial | C | Adjacent companies table covers LEU, CCJ, BWXT but no ETF/futures/physical trust mapping. Not directly relevant for single-stock analysis. |
| B1. Supply Architecture | Primary production, secondary supply, enrichment capacity | Yes | A | Russian 85% dominance, Western capacity constraints, specific competitor capacity data. Strong. |
| B2. Demand Decomposition | Reactor fleet, new construction, SMR, HALEU, contract/spot | Yes | B+ | HALEU demand well-covered via TerraPower. SMR pipeline referenced (NuScale, Oklo). Missing fleet-level quantification (440 reactors, 180 Mlbs/year). Acceptable — report is equity-focused, not commodity-focused. |
| B3. Inventory & Contracting | Utility inventories, strategic reserves, uncovered requirements | No | D | Not addressed. Acceptable omission — ASPI is a supplier, not a commodity thesis. Contracting dynamics referenced via take-or-pay agreements. |
| C1. Energy Policy & Nuclear Renaissance | Pro-nuclear policies, COP, IRA, AI/data center demand | Partial | C+ | DOE contracts referenced. Missing COP28 triple-capacity pledge, IRA production tax credits, AI/data center nuclear PPAs. These are background context, not core to ASPI equity thesis. |
| C2. Geopolitical & Supply Chain Risk | Russia dependency, Kazakhstan, Western rebuilding, sanctions | Yes | A | Central to thesis. Russian dominance, US import ban, sanctions framework thoroughly covered. |
| C3. Technology & Reactor Evolution | Gen III+, SMR, Gen IV, fusion | Partial | B- | TerraPower Natrium, NuScale, Oklo referenced. Missing broader reactor pipeline quantification. Adequate for equity analysis. |
| D. Financial Logic & Valuation | Marginal cost, replacement cost, contract vs spot, price scenarios | Yes | A- | Valuation section with P/S, EV/S, P/B, DCF, analyst consensus, dilution analysis. Price scenario matrix not included (commodity playbook element, less relevant for equity). |
| E. IDP Flagging | Divergence patterns | Yes | A | 7 IDPs identified with timing and monitoring guidance. Strong. |
| F. Investigation Tracks | 3 tracks proposed | Yes | A | Revenue conversion, regulatory pathway, cash burn/dilution. Specific, actionable, with data source references. |

**Fission Thesis Composite: B+**

## Strategic Materials Coverage (Specialist Isotopes Segment)

| Section | Required | Covered | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. Commodity Classification | Classify primary commodity exposure, end-market demand | Yes | A | Multi-isotope portfolio mapped to end-markets (quantum, pharma, medical, nuclear). Demand growth quantified. |
| B. Chokepoint Analysis | Mining concentration, processing, policy exposure, recycling | Yes | A | Russia 85% concentration is the defining chokepoint. Policy exposure (US import ban) covered. Recycling not applicable to isotope enrichment. |
| C. Project-Level Economics | AISC, capex timeline, permitting, jurisdiction risk, offtake | Partial | B | Permitting (NNR) covered. Offtake (RC-14 take-or-pay, Si-28 customers) referenced. Missing explicit AISC and capex-per-facility quantification. Acceptable — company has not disclosed granular project economics. |
| D. Financial Logic & Valuation | NAV, EV/Resource, commodity-price DCF | Yes | B+ | DCF, P/S, P/B, analyst targets provided. NAV and EV/Resource not applicable (enrichment services vs mining assets). Milestone-based probability-weighted approach implicitly reflected in bull/bear analysis. |
| E. IDP Flagging | Resource estimate upgrades, nationalism, disruption, substitution | Yes | A- | 7 IDPs mapped. Substitution risk not deeply explored (limited for enriched isotopes — no practical substitute). |
| F. Investigation Tracks | 3 tracks | Yes | A | Three well-defined tracks with specific questions and data sources. |

**Strategic Materials Composite: A-**

## Structural & Quality Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tone: Professional, empirical | A | No promotional language. Data-dense. Balanced bull/bear. |
| Completeness: All major business segments covered | A | Nuclear fuels, specialist isotopes, Renergen/helium, radiopharmacy. |
| Competitive landscape depth | A | 6 HALEU competitors, 3 specialty isotope competitors, helium ecosystem. Tables with technology, status, differentiators. |
| Financial data accuracy | A- | Data sourced from public filings and market data. Minor note: some metrics are search-sourced, not directly from 10-Q. |
| Actionability: Clear monitoring framework | A | 90-day catalysts, investigation tracks with data sources, portfolio construction guidance. |
| Adjacent companies | A | 9 companies mapped with relevance and watch metrics. |
| Thesis clarity | A | Four structural pillars clearly articulated. Risk-adjusted verdict with position sizing guidance. |

**Structural Composite: A**

## Overall Report Grade: **A-**

**Weighted Score:** (Fission Thesis 40% × B+ = 3.3) + (Strategic Materials 40% × A- = 3.7) + (Structural 20% × A = 4.0) = **3.54 / 4.0**

**Summary:** Comprehensive equity research report covering a company that spans two distinct playbooks. Strong on supply chain geopolitics, competitive landscape, financial analysis, and catalyst identification. Minor gaps in commodity-level detail (reactor fleet quantification, uncovered requirements) are acceptable omissions for an equity-focused analysis. The report provides clear, actionable monitoring framework and risk-adjusted portfolio guidance.

**Improvement opportunities for future iterations:**
1. Add granular capex-per-facility estimates when company discloses
2. Deepen reactor pipeline analysis (fleet quantification, SMR order pipeline)
3. Track insider transactions as leading indicator
4. Model dilution scenarios with specific share price / raise size assumptions
5. Add customer concentration analysis when quarterly revenue data available
